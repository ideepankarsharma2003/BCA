Being able to interpret visual information might be one of the greatest
possession in gifts to humans or any other living organism out there, and it has
become incredible when we have managed to pass this gift to the computers to
a great extent. Still computer vision is not like human vision , the images need
to go through a lots of seriously complex mathematical as well as logical
operations in order to process a result based on it. After the efforts of scientists
for decades, computer vision has been in image recognition, classification, detection and segmentation, search, synthetic made great achievements. This
paper discusses the related concepts and applications of computer vision (CV)
for augmented reality that enables computers to obtain, process, analyze and
understand digital videos and images as well as the potential downsides that
might be experienced.
